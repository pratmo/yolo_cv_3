YOLO Video Object Detection in 3 Lines of Code

## Notes

The fewer frames a video has, the less time it takes to complete the process. If you are just testing the project, it is recommended to use a video that is less than 20 or 30 seconds long.

An example video file and the resulting processed video can be found in this directory. These provide a clear demonstration of the YOLO object detection process in action.

An article explaining this project can be found here.
